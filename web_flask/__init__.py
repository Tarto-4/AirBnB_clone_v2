# AirBnB_clone_v2 - web_flask

This directory contains a simple Flask web application demonstrating a route.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3 (tested with 3.4.3)
* Flask framework

**Files:**

* `0-hello_route.py`: Flask application with a route displaying "Hello HBNB!"
* `__init__.py` (Optional): Empty file to mark the directory as a package (for future expansion)

**Instructions:**

1. Save the code snippets above in the corresponding files (`0-hello_route.py`, optional `__init__.py`).
2. Open a terminal in the `web_flask` directory.
3. Run the application: `python3 0-hello_route.py`
4. Access the application in your browser: http://localhost:5000/

You should see "Hello HBNB!" displayed on the page.

**Additional Notes:**

* The application listens on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 5000.
* The route definition uses `strict_slashes=False` to handle trailing slashes consistently.

This example provides a basic foundation for building Flask web applications. You can explore further to define more complex routes, implement templating engines for dynamic content, and connect to databases.
